In digital image processing and computer vision, image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple image segments, also known as image regions or image objects.
The goal of segmentation is to simplify and change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.
Image segmentation is typically used to locate objects and boundaries in images.
More precisely, image segmentation is the process of assigning a label to every pixel in an image such that pixels with the same label share certain characteristics.
